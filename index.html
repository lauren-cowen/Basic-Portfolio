					<p class="aboutMe"> I am an aspiring web developer currently attending the coding bootcampt at UT Austin. I am origianlly from San Antonio, TX and I moved to Austin after graduating high school. I graduated from the University of Texas with a Bachelor's in English in 2014. After graduation, I have worked in customer service and sales positions. I spent 3 years at Apple providing customer service to developers distributing their apps on the App Store. I recently started a new position researching leads for the sales team at Indeed.com.  </p>

					<br>

					<p class = "aboutMe"> I took two years of computer science in high school and leared basic java skills. During college, I practiced HTML and CSS in my spare time. I am excited to further my knowledge in web development throughout this course. In my spare time, I enjoy binge watching tv series on Netflix, online gaming, and roller skating. </p>
